<h1><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/create-a-dataframe-from-list/description/">2877. Create a DataFrame from List</a></h1>

<p>Given a list <code>student_data</code>, which is a 2D list containing the IDs and ages of some students, write a function to create a DataFrame with two columns, <code>student_id</code> and <code>age</code>, in the same order as the original 2D list.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
student_data:
[
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
<strong>Output:</strong>
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
A DataFrame was created on top of student_data, with two columns named student_id and age.</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of <code>student_data</code> is at most 1000.</li>
	<li>The student ID is in the range of [1, 1000000], and the age is in the range of [1, 100].</li>
</ul>
